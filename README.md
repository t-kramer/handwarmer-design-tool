# Simplified heat flux model for handwarmer design


## Assumptions

- **Radiation** is **primary heat transfer mechanism**
- Assuming still air and no forced air movement; therefore **heat gain via convection is negligible** and *h* (convective heat transfer coefficient) is very low
- Considering **heat loss via convection**, particularly at high deltas between hand and environmental temperatures
- Not considering the **impact of conduction** (e.g. heat loss to colder table or keyboard) and evaporation
